=================================================================

1. Introduction
----------------

1Map, the UAE's national geospatial platform, provides a valuable resource for various sectors. 
Integrating Orfeo ToolBox (OTB), a powerful open-source library for geospatial image processing, 
can significantly enhance 1Map's capabilities. This document explores potential use cases 
and benefits of incorporating OTB into 1Map's infrastructure.

2. Potential Use Cases
----------------------

Image Processing and Analysis

**Pre-processing**:

- **Radiometric Calibration**: Correct for atmospheric effects, sensor variations, and other factors to improve image accuracy.
- **Geometric Correction**: Correct for geometric distortions in satellite imagery, ensuring accurate geolocation.
- **Atmospheric Correction**: Remove atmospheric effects like haze and aerosols to improve image clarity and accuracy.

**Change Detection**:

- **Monitor Urban Growth**: Track changes in land cover and land use over time.
- **Assess Environmental Impacts**: Detect changes in vegetation, water bodies, and coastal areas.
- **Identify Areas of Change**: Detect changes in infrastructure, such as road construction or building development.

**Image Classification**:

- **Land Cover/Land Use Mapping**: Classify different land cover types (e.g., urban, vegetation, water) using supervised and unsupervised classification techniques.
- **Object Detection**: Detect and identify objects of interest in imagery, such as buildings, vehicles, and ships.

**Feature Extraction**:

- **Extract Features from Imagery**: Extract features such as roads, rivers, and buildings for further analysis and mapping.
- **Generate Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)**: Generate DEMs from stereo imagery for applications like hydrological modeling and terrain analysis.

Data Integration and Analysis
--------------

- **Integrate Various Geospatial Data Sources**: Combine satellite imagery, LiDAR data, and other geospatial datasets for comprehensive analysis.
- **Perform Spatial Analysis**: Conduct spatial analysis tasks such as buffer analysis, overlay analysis, and proximity analysis.
